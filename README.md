## 🛠️ Important Links & Tools

Datasets: Access to the project dataset (CSV files).

SQL Server Express: Lightweight server for hosting your SQL database.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): GUI for managing and interacting with databases.

Git Repository: Set up a GitHub account and repository to manage, version, and collaborate on your code efficiently.


## 📋 Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications

Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.

Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.

Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

## 📊 BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

Customer Behavior

Product Performance

Sales Trends

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.

#### 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

Bronze Layer

Stores raw data from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.

Silver Layer

This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.

Gold Layer

Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
